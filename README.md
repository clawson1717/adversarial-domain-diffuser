# Adversarial-Domain-Diffuser

A domain-specific agentic framework that uses Adversarial Question Generation to identify comprehension gaps and Online Multi-Agent Diffusion Policies to coordinate complex, interpretative reasoning tasks.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Core logic and agent implementations.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
- `data/`: Directory for synthetic samples and datasets.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Concept

This project implements a multi-agent framework focused on:
1. **Adversarial Question Generation**: Identifying gaps in model comprehension.
2. **Online Multi-Agent Diffusion Policies**: Coordinating complex reasoning tasks across multiple agents.
